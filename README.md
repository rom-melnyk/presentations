# Types in TypeScript

The demo for [this article](https://melnyk.site/post/11).

1. Run `npm install`.
1. Run `npm start -- ./samples/filename.ts` to see how samples work (or don't if intended).
1. Run `npm run compile -- ./samples/filename.ts` to compile the file into JS (will be placed in the same folder).  
  Mind that both commands remove JS (compiled) files if any from `./samples`.
